# Assembly Endgame

Assembly Endgame is a hangman-style word-guessing game with a unique twist. Instead of a man being hanged, the game uses programming languages as the stakes. Your goal is to guess the word before the only language left is Assembly, which is notoriously difficult to work with.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Guess the word by selecting letters. Each incorrect guess brings you closer to using Assembly.
- **Dynamic Feedback**: Visual and textual feedback for correct and incorrect guesses.
- **Confetti Celebration**: Celebrate your victory with a burst of confetti.
- **Accessible Design**: Screen reader support for an inclusive gaming experience.

## How It Works

1. **Start the Game**: A random word is selected from a predefined list.
2. **Make Guesses**: Click on letters to guess the word. Correct guesses reveal the letters in the word.
3. **Track Progress**: Each incorrect guess changes the background to a different programming language.
4. **Win or Lose**: Guess the word before all languages are exhausted to win. If not, you'll be left with Assembly.
